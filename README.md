A tutorial for setting up CI/CD 


## Why CI/CD ?
Today continuous integration is made dead simple by a growing number of CI/CD services like Gitlab CI, Bitbucket pipelines, CircleCI, and Github workflow.
But is continuous integration really worth it? Considering how simple is to set up a build/test pipeline today there should be no more reasons for avoiding CI/CD, even when a project has a short-ish lifespan.
All it takes to start with automated testing and continuous integration in JavaScript, with a bit of help from Github.
