## Explaination:
The workflow has a name, "JavaScript workflow", runs on every push, and as a result it creates a virtual Ubuntu environment with Node.js 12.x 


In the repo create a new folder named .github/workflows/:
  mkdir -p .github/workflows/
  
Create a new file named javascript.yml in .github/workflows/.
Configure our first workflow like so:
*********************************************
name: JavaScript workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1 ## Github Action ??
      - name: "MyCustom Node12 Server"
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1 ## Github Action ??
        with:
          node-version: "12.x"
      - name: "npm install, and test"
        run: |
          npm install
          npm test
        env:
          CI: true ## optional
*********************************************

Then commit and push to your repo.

Then go to https://github.com/[YOUR PROFILE NAME]/[YOUR REPO NAME]/actions
